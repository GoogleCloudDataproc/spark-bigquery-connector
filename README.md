# Apache Spark SQL connector for Google BigQuery (Beta)

<!--- TODO(#2): split out into more documents. -->

The connector uses the [Spark SQL Data Source API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html#data-sources) to read data from [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/).

## Beta Disclaimer

The BigQuery Storage API and this connector are in Beta and are subject to change.

Changes may include, but are not limited to:
* Type conversion
* Partitioning
* Parameters

Breaking changes will be restricted to major and minor versions.

## BigQuery Storage API
The [Storage API](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/storage) streams data in parallel directly from BigQuery via gRPC without using Google Cloud Storage as an intermediary.

It has a number of advantages over using the previous export-based read flow that should generally lead to better read performance:

### Direct Streaming

It does not leave any temporary files in Google Cloud Storage. Rows are read directly from BigQuery servers using an Avro wire format.

### Filtering

The new API allows column and limited predicate filtering to only read the data you are interested in.

#### Column Filtering

Since BigQuery is [backed by a columnar datastore](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2016/04/inside-capacitor-bigquerys-next-generation-columnar-storage-format), it can efficiently stream data without reading all columns.

#### Predicate Filtering

The Storage API supports limited pushdown of predicate filters. It supports a single comparison to a literal e.g.

```
col1 = 'val'
```

### Dynamic Sharding

The API rebalances records between readers until they all complete. This means that all Map phases will finish nearly concurrently. See this blog article on [how dynamic sharding is similarly used in Google Cloud Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2016/05/no-shard-left-behind-dynamic-work-rebalancing-in-google-cloud-dataflow).

See [Configuring Partitioning](#configuring-partitioning) for more details.

## Requirements

### Enable the BigQuery Storage API

Follow [these instructions](
https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/storage/#enabling_the_api).

### Create a Google Cloud Dataproc cluster (Optional)

If you do not have an Apache Spark environment you can create a Cloud Dataproc cluster with pre-configured auth. The following examples assume you are using Cloud Dataproc, but you can use `spark-submit` on any cluster.

Any Dataproc cluster using the API needs the 'bigquery'  or 'cloud-platform' scopes. Dataproc clusters have the 'bigquery' scope by default, so most clusters in enabled projects should work by default e.g.

```
MY_CLUSTER=...
gcloud dataproc clusters create "$MY_CLUSTER"
```

## Downloading the Connector

The latest version connector of the connector is publicly available in [gs://spark-lib/bigquery/spark-bigquery-latest.jar](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/spark-lib/bigquery).

## Hello World Example

You can run a simple PySpark wordcount against the API without compilation by running

<!--- TODO(pmkc): Update jar reference -->

```
gcloud dataproc jobs submit pyspark --cluster "$MY_CLUSTER" \
  --jars gs://spark-lib/bigquery/spark-bigquery-latest.jar \
Â  examples/python/shakespeare.py
```

## Compiling against the connector

Unless you wish to use the implicit Scala API `spark.read.bigquery("TABLE_ID")`, there is no need to compile against the connector.

To include the connector in your project:

### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.cloud.spark</groupId>
  <artifactId>spark-bigquery_${scala.version}</artifactId>
  <version>0.5.1-beta</version>
</dependency>
```

### SBT

```sbt
libraryDependencies += "com.google.cloud.spark" %% "spark-bigquery" % "0.5.1-beta"
```

## API

The connector uses the cross language [Spark SQL Data Source API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html#data-sources):

```
df = spark.read
  .format("bigquery")
  .option("table", "publicdata.samples.shakespeare")
  .load()
```

or the Scala only implicit API:

```
import com.google.cloud.spark.bigquery._
val df: DataFrame = spark.read.bigquery("publicdata.samples.shakespeare")
```

See [Shakespeare.scala](src/main/scala/com/google/cloud/spark/bigquery/examples/Shakespeare.scala) and [shakespeare.py](examples/python/shakespeare.py) for more information.

### Properties

The API Supports a number of options to configure the read

### Data types

With the exception of `DATETIME` and `TIME` all BigQuery data types directed map into the corresponding Spark SQL data type. Here are all of the mappings:

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>BigQuery Standard SQL Data Type </strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Spark SQL</strong>
<p>
<strong>Data Type</strong>

   <td>Spark has no DATETIME type. Casting to TIMESTAMP uses a configured TimeZone, which defaults to the local timezone (UTC in GCE / Dataproc).
<p>
We are considering adding an optional TimeZone property to allow automatically  converting to TimeStamp, this would be consistent with Spark's handling of CSV/JSON (except they always try to convert when inferring schema, and default to the local timezone)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong><code>TIME</code></strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong><code>LongType</code></strong>
   </td>
   <td>Spark has no TIME type. The generated longs, which indicate <a href="https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.8.0/spec.html#Time+%2528microsecond+precision%2529">microseconds since midnight</a> can be safely cast to TimestampType, but this causes the date to be inferred as the current day. Thus times are left as longs and user can cast if they like.
<p>
When casting to Timestamp TIME have the same TimeZone issues as DATETIME
   </td>
  </tr>

### Filtering

The connector automatically computes column and pushdown filters the DataFrame's `SELECT` statement e.g.

```
spark.read.bigquery("publicdata:samples.shakespeare")
  .select("word")
  .where("word = 'Hamlet'")
  .collect()
```


filters to the column `word`  and pushed down the predicate filter `word = 'hamlet'`.

If you do not wish to make multiple read requests to BigQuery, you can cache the DataFrame before filtering e.g.:

```
val cachedDF = spark.read.bigquery("publicdata:samples.shakespeare").cache()
val rows = cachedDF.select("word")
  .where("word = 'Hamlet'")
  .collect()
// All of the table was cached and this doesn't require an API call
val otherRows = cachedDF.select("word_count")
  .where("word = 'Romeo'")
  .collect()
```

You can also manually specify the `filter` option, which will override automatic pushdown and Spark will do the rest of the filtering in the client.

### Configuring Partitioning

By default the connector creates one partition per current core available (Spark Default Parallelism) to get maximum concurrent bandwidth. This can be configured explicitly with the <code>

[parallelism](#properties)</code> property. BigQuery may limit the number of partitions based on server constraints.

If not all partitions are currently being read some partitions may grow larger and some may be smaller or even empty. The fraction that partitions are allowed to grow beyond the expected total number of rows / number of partitions is bounded by the <code>

[skewLimit](#properties)</code> parameter. The limit is soft and does not guarantee exact partitioning especially on small tables.

## Building the Connector

The connector is built using [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/):

```
sbt assembly
```

## FAQ

### What is the Pricing for the Storage API?

See the [BigQuery pricing documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#storage-api).

### I have very few partitions

You can manually set the number of partitions with the `parallelism` property. BigQuery may provide fewer partitions than you ask for. See [Configuring Partitioning](#configuring-partitioning).

You can also always repartition after reading in Spark.

### I have empty partitions

Because the Storage API balances records between partitions as you read, if you don't schedule all of your map tasks concurrently, the last scheduled partitions may be empty.

Decreasing the skewLimit parameter to 1.0 (or something near it) should make your parttions more uniform (at the expense of tail latency). Alternatively you can increase your cluster size to schedule all partitions concurrently. See [Configuring Partitioning](#configuring-partitioning)

You can also always repartition after reading in Spark, which should remove the empty partitions.

### How do I write to BigQuery?

You can use the [existing MapReduce connector](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bigdata-interop/tree/master/bigquery) or write DataFrames to GCS and then load the data into BigQuery.

### How do I authenticate outside GCE / Dataproc?

Use a service account JSON key and `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` as described [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started).
