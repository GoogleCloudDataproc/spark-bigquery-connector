## 0.16.0 - 2020-06-09
**Please don't use this version, use 0.16.1 instead**

* PR #180: Apache Arrow is now the default read format. Based on our benchmarking, Arrow provides read
  performance faster by 40% then Avro.
* PR #163: Apache Avro was added as a write intermediate format. It shows better performance over parquet
  in large (>50GB) datasets. The spark-avro package must be added in runtime in order to use this format.
* PR #176: Usage simplification: Now instead of using the `table` mandatory option, user can use the built
  in `path` parameter of `load()` and `save()`, so that read becomes
  `df = spark.read.format("bigquery").load("source_table")` and write becomes
  `df.write.format("bigquery").save("target_table")`
* An experimental implementation of the DataSource v2 API has been added. **It is not ready for
  production use.**

  The method now verifies the path exists before trying to delete it, and
  hides the redundant exception.
* Added support for data.write.bigquery("table") implicit import, fixed
  regression caused by relying of shaded scalalogging

## 0.9.0-beta - 2019-10-08
* Added write support

  StringContains etc.)
