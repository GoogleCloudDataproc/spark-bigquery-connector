## 0.16.1 - 2020-06-11
* PR #186: Fixed SparkBigQueryConnectorUserAgentProvider initialization bug

## 0.16.0 - 2020-06-09
**Please don't use this version, use 0.16.1 instead**

* PR #180: Apache Arrow is now the default read format. Based on our benchmarking, Arrow provides read
  performance faster by 40% then Avro.
* PR #163: Apache Avro was added as a write intermediate format. It shows better performance over parquet
  in large (>50GB) datasets. The spark-avro package must be added in runtime in order to use this format.
* PR #176: Usage simplification: Now instead of using the `table` mandatory option, user can use the built
  in `path` parameter of `load()` and `save()`, so that read becomes
  `df = spark.read.format("bigquery").load("source_table")` and write becomes
  `df.write.format("bigquery").save("target_table")`
* An experimental implementation of the DataSource v2 API has been added. **It is not ready for
  production use.**
* BigQuery API has been upgraded to version 1.116.1

## 0.13.1-beta - 2020-02-14
* The BigQuery Storage API was reverted to v1beta1. The v1beta2 API has not been
  fully integrated with custom IAM roles, which can cause issues to customers using
  those. The v1beta1 doesn't have this problem. Once the integration is complete,
  the API will be upgraded again.

## 0.13.0-beta - 2020-02-12
**Please don't use this version, use 0.13.1-beta instead**

  to BigQuery.

## 0.12.0-beta - 2020-01-29
* Issue #72: Moved the shaded jar name from classifier to a new artifact name
* Issues #73, #87: Added better logging to help understand which columns and filters
  are asked by spark, and which are passed down to BigQuery

* Supporting reading large rows (Issue #22, https://issuetracker.google.com/143730055)
* Made sure that all filters are pushed down (Issue #74)
* Fixing log severity
* Added Java Example

## 0.9.1-beta - 2019-10-11
* A NPE in the shutdown hook has occurred in case the delete had succeeded
  in the first time. This had no impact on the actual logic, just on the log.
  The method now verifies the path exists before trying to delete it, and
  hides the redundant exception.
* Added support for data.write.bigquery("table") implicit import, fixed 
  regression caused by relying of shaded scalalogging

## 0.9.0-beta - 2019-10-08
* Added write support
* Switch requested partitions from SparkContext.defaultParallelism to one
  partition per 400MB. This should work better with balanced sharding and
  dynamic allocation.
* Cross built for both Scala 2.11 and 2.12
* Upgrade version of google-cloud-bigquery library to 1.96.0
* Upgrade version of google-cloud-bigquerystorage library to 0.114.0-beta

* Added a shaded version

## 0.8.0-beta - 2019-07-22
* Upgrade version of google-cloud-bigquery library to 1.82.0
* Upgrade version of google-cloud-bigquerystorage library to 0.98.0-beta
* Upgrade version of grpc-netty-shaded library to 1.22.1
* Use balanced sharding strategy to assign roughly same number of rows to each
  read stream.
* Update filtering support to reflect full set of filters supported by storage
  API (multi-clause predicates, pseudo-column variables, additional filter
  clauses - IsNull, IsNotNull, In, StringStartsWith, StringEndsWith,
  StringContains etc.)

## 0.7.0-beta - 2019-06-26
* Switch to using the BALANCED sharding strategy, which balances work between
  streams on the server-side, leading to a more uniform distribution of rows
  between partitions

* Support specifying credentials through configurations

## 0.5.1-beta - 2019-04-26
